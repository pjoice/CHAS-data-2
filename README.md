# CHAS-data-2

## Second attempt at a CHAS repo. 

Master branch will be the "current" iteration. Historical data documentation and code will be stored on separate branches.

Within each branch, there will be: 

a) a spreadsheet with the HUD median family income (HAMFI) used for that years' CHAS, 

b) SAS code used by Census to "recode" ACS variables

c) a spreadsheet with the specifications used by Census to produce tabulations

d) SAS code used by HUD to process and transform the "raw" data files provided by Census

e) a spreadsheet that documents the content of the "final" CHAS data files published on HUD User
